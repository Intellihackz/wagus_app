# Tokenomics Plan for WAGUS

## 1. Overview
WAGUS is designed to create a balanced and sustainable token ecosystem that rewards long-term holders, incentivizes contributors, and ensures price stability through structured allocations. This document outlines the token distribution model, vesting schedules, and incentives.

### Total Supply: **1,000,000,000 (1 Billion) Tokens**
The total supply will be manually distributed across different allocations, ensuring stability and long-term growth while maintaining fairness between public investors and internal stakeholders.

## 2. Token Allocation
To maintain fairness and avoid insider dominance, we have adjusted the distribution to reflect a **30% allocation to the team** while ensuring a sustainable structure for the ecosystem.

| **Category**               | **Percentage** | **Token Amount**  | **Vesting/Release Schedule** |
|---------------------------|--------------|----------------|--------------------------------|
| **Public Sale & Liquidity** | 35%          | 350,000,000    | Fully unlocked at launch, liquidity pool partially locked |
| **Team & Advisors**       | 30%          | 300,000,000    | 1-year cliff, then 10% unlock per quarter via Streamflow |
| **Rewards & Staking**     | 20%          | 200,000,000    | Gradually distributed as staking incentives |
| **Marketing & Growth**    | 7.5%         | 75,000,000     | Monthly controlled releases based on growth milestones |
| **Treasury & Buybacks**   | 7.5%         | 75,000,000     | DAO-governed releases for ecosystem development |

## 3. Ensuring Fairness & Long-Term Sustainability
To maintain a fair and trustable tokenomics model, the following measures are in place:

- **Public Sale & Liquidity (35%)**: Ensures that a significant portion of tokens is available for public investors while balancing team allocation.
- **Team & Advisor Vesting (30%)**: To prevent early dumps, team tokens will have a **1-year cliff** followed by **gradual 10% unlocks per quarter** via **Streamflow Finance**.
- **Staking Rewards (20%)**: These tokens are not controlled by the team but **distributed to public stakers over time**.
- **Marketing & Treasury (15%)**: These funds will be strategically released based on milestones and managed transparently through **DAO governance**.

## 4. Incentives for Holding & Participation
We will implement a variety of incentives to encourage long-term participation:

### 1. Staking Rewards (20% of Supply)
- Users who stake tokens will earn rewards based on their staking duration.
- Higher APY for **long-term stakers**.
- Staking rewards are released in a controlled manner to prevent inflation.

### 2. Governance Power (DAO Treasury - 7.5%)
- Holders can participate in **governance voting** (e.g., protocol upgrades, reward changes).
- Treasury funds are **community-controlled** for buybacks, burns, and future development.

### 3. Buyback & Burn Mechanism (Treasury Allocation)
- A portion of transaction fees will be used to **buy back tokens from the market and burn them**, reducing supply over time.
- This ensures long-term **price appreciation and scarcity**.
